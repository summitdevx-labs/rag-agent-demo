# ðŸ“Œ Experimental AI Agent â€” LangChain + OpenAI + FAISS

Lightweight experimental agent that answers user queries by retrieving local PDF context (FAISS), summarizing with an LLM (OpenAI via LangChain), and â€” when needed â€” falling back to a web search to refine answers.

Key features

- Natural-language user queries

- Local context retrieval from FAISS (PDF embeddings)

- LLM-based summarization & response generation (OpenAI through LangChain)

- Web-search fallback when local context is insufficient

- Final, consolidated, user-friendly answer

- Modular design for easy swap-in of components (vector DB, LLM, search)

## Why this project

Useful when you have a body of PDFs (internal docs, manuals, research papers) and want an agent that:

1. Retrieves relevant passages quickly (FAISS),

2. Produces concise, high-quality answers (OpenAI LLM),

3. Supplements knowledge from the web only when the local corpus is missing key context.

## Architecture (high level)

User â†’ Agent API â†’ FAISS (local) â†’ LLM (OpenAI via LangChain) â†’ (optional) Web Search â†’ Final Answer

## Quickstart (local dev)

Assumes Python 3.10+, pip, and a local FAISS index of PDF embeddings.
