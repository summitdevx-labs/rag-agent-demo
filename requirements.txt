Requirement Document: Experimental AI Agent
1. Objective

Develop an experimental AI agent that leverages LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS to process user queries, retrieve contextual knowledge, and generate refined answers.

2. Scope

The agent will:

Accept natural language queries from users.

Use local knowledge (PDF embeddings stored in FAISS) for contextual retrieval.

Summarize and answer queries with the help of an LLM.

Use a web search tool if local context is insufficient.

Deliver a final, refined, user-friendly answer.

3. Functional Requirements

Input Handling

Accept free-text user queries.

Context Retrieval

Search and retrieve relevant chunks from a local FAISS vector database containing PDF embeddings.

Summarization & Response

Pass retrieved context to an LLM (OpenAI via LangChain) for summarization and initial response generation.

Fallback Search

If the LLM response is incomplete/unsatisfactory:

Call a web search tool to fetch additional context.

Merge new context with prior retrieved information.

Final Response

Generate and return a refined, complete answer to the user.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

Accuracy: Responses should be contextually relevant and coherent.

Performance: Query processing should return results within a reasonable time (<5 seconds for local retrieval, <10 seconds with web search).

Scalability: System should handle multiple queries concurrently.

Modularity: Each component (FAISS, LLM, Web Search) should be loosely coupled for future upgrades.

5. Technology Stack

LangChain: Agent orchestration.

OpenAI LLM (GPT models): Summarization and response generation.

FAISS: Vector database for PDF embeddings.

Web Search Tool: Fallback context retrieval.

6. Success Criteria

80% of user queries satisfactorily answered from FAISS context alone.

Smooth fallback to web search when required.

Final answers must be clear, concise, and contextually correct.
